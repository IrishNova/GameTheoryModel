**# Contributing to Multi-Country Trade Simulation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this game theory model of international trade relationships! This project simulates trade interactions between major economies using real FX data and leadership dynamics.

## Project Overview

This is an academic research project that models:
- **Game Theory**: Iterated prisoner's dilemma with multiple strategies
- **Real FX Data**: Actual currency volatilities from Interactive Brokers
- **Leadership Dynamics**: Including volatile/unpredictable behavior patterns
- **Reserve Currency Effects**: Modeling advantages of reserve currency status

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required Python packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy networkx
pip install ib_insync  # For IBKR data collection (optional)
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-strategy-model
   ```

2. **Code Standards**
   - Follow existing naming conventions (`snake_case` for variables/functions)
   - Add docstrings to all new classes and methods
   - Include type hints where applicable
   - Keep functions focused and modular

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Test new strategies with `simulation/engine.py`
   - Run Monte Carlo validation with `simulation/monte_carlo.py`
   - Verify results with `analysis/results_compiler.py` (subset)

4. **Documentation**
   - Update docstrings for any modified functions
   - Add comments for complex game theory logic
   - Update README.md if adding new features

### Code Style Guidelines

**Strategy Implementation**
```python
def choose_action(self, opponent_name: str) -> int:
    """
    Choose cooperation (0) or defection (1) based on strategy.
    
    Args:
        opponent_name: Name of the opposing country
        
    Returns:
        0 for cooperation, 1 for defection
    """
    # Strategy logic here
    pass
```

**Simulation Extensions**
```python
class CustomLeadershipDynamics:
    """Custom leadership behavior model"""
    
    def __init__(self, profile_params: Dict):
        """Initialize with research-backed parameters"""
        pass
        
    def process_month(self, month: int, country: Country, 
                     conditions: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Process monthly leadership decisions"""
        pass
```

## Adding New Features

### New Country Strategies

1. **Implement in `core/country.py`**
   ```python
   elif self.strategy == 'your_new_strategy':
       return self._your_strategy_logic(opponent_name)
   ```

2. **Add strategy method**
   ```python
   def _your_strategy_logic(self, opponent_name: str) -> int:
       """Implement your strategy logic with game theory rationale"""
       pass
   ```

3. **Test extensively**
   - Run against all existing strategies
   - Validate with tournament play
   - Check edge cases and convergence

### New Economic Data

1. **Add to `config/parameters.py`**
   ```python
   NEW_ECONOMIC_DATA = {
       'parameter_name': value,
       'source': 'Research Source',
       'date_collected': '2024-XX-XX'
   }
   ```

2. **Update country configurations**
   - Modify `config/countries_data.py` as needed
   - Ensure backward compatibility

3. **Document data sources**
   - Add citation in docstring
   - Include data collection methodology

### New Leadership Dynamics

1. **Extend `dynamics/leadership.py`**
2. **Create new profile class**
3. **Test with existing countries**
4. **Validate historical plausibility**

## Experimental Standards

### Statistical Rigor

- **Minimum iterations**: 50 for preliminary testing, 200 for publication
- **Convergence testing**: Use `analysis/convergence_test.py`
- **Confidence intervals**: Include error bars in all results
- **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds for validation

### Scenario Testing

When adding new scenarios:

1. **Baseline comparison**: Always compare to existing baseline
2. **Multiple iterations**: Use Monte Carlo approach
3. **Statistical significance**: Test for meaningful differences
4. **Real-world plausibility**: Ensure scenarios are realistic
