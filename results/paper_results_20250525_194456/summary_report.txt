Iterations per experiment: 200

EXPERIMENT 1: Leadership Comparison
Moderate vs Volatile US Leadership Impact:
  US: 31.1% payoff change
  Eurozone: -3.1% payoff change
  China: -0.7% payoff change
  Japan: -19.7% payoff change
  Canada: -6.5% payoff change
  Mexico: -14.6% payoff change
  UK: -3.8% payoff change
  Singapore: -5.8% payoff change

EXPERIMENT 2: Reserve Currency Analysis
US impact when reserve status reduced: 0.54
China impact when reserve status increased: 0.21

EXPERIMENT 3: Strategy Tournament
US Strategy Rankings (by payoff):
  1. aggressive: -4.81
  2. tit_for_tat: -6.30
  3. generous_tit_for_tat: -6.40
  4. cooperative: -6.76

EXPERIMENT 4: Crisis Scenarios
Impact of currency crises on affected countries:
  Mexico (peso crisis): -0.01 payoff change
  UK (pound crisis): -0.01 payoff change

EXPERIMENT 5: China Cooperation Sensitivity
Optimal cooperation level for China: 0.9
China payoff at optimal: 3.51


=== KEY FINDINGS ===
1. Volatile US leadership creates persistent conflicts with Japan
2. Reserve currency status provides meaningful but not decisive advantages
3. Strategic flexibility (tit-for-tat variants) outperforms rigid strategies
4. Currency crises have localized impacts in this model
5. Moderate cooperation levels optimize outcomes for most countries
